# Master's Thesis

This project is a work in progress. 

This repository contains code, data and checkpoints for running the experiments of my Master's Thesis that is a component of my Mathematics and Computer Science (MEng) degree.

Creating a Natural Language Processing model to perform document classification on a dataset containing tweets of people affected by natural disasters. The model is based on the state-of-the-art proof-of-concept “ExpBERT” model (derived from the seminal BERT model) that was created by researchers at Stanford University. The model’s classifier uses a list of explanations created by humans to correct its mistakes, similar to how humans learn. Built using PyTorch and HuggingFace.


The project is based on the following paper:

> [ExpBERT: Representation Engineering with Natural Language Explanations]

The dataset is from:
